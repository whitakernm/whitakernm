- 👋 Hi, I’m @whitakernm
- 👀 I’m interested in medieval literature, digital humanities, libraries, and culture. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning... I think a better way to put it is I am trying to learn everything I can. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on digitial humanities projects because I learn best by doing.
